# What is

## Instruction set

Following is a definition from http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/instset.htm

> The instruction set, also called instruction set architecture (ISA), is a part of the computer that pertains to programming, which is basically machine language. The instruction set provides commands to the processor, to tell it what it needs to do. The instruction set consists of multiple pieces, including addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers, memory architecture, interrupt, and exception handling, and external I/O.

> An example of an instruction set is the x86 instruction set, which is common to find on computers today. Different computer processors can use almost the same instruction set, while still having very different internal design. Both the Intel Pentium and AMD Athlon processors use nearly the same x86 instruction set. An instruction set can be built into the hardware of the processor, or it can be emulated in software, using an interpreter. The hardware design is more efficient and faster for running programs than the emulated software version.

# Difference between

### ```chipset``` and a ```processor```

> Simply put, the cpu is the main processor in the computer (does all of the calculations) whereas the chipset is the bits that connect the cpu to the rest of the computer. The chipset is also the bit that can dictate which cpus the motherboard can support.

### ```Instruction Set Architecture``` and ```Micro Architecture```

> __Instruction Set Architecture__ (ISA) is an interface between software developer and the hardware.

> __Micro Architecture__ is how the ISA is implemented
